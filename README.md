# INTRO TO REACT 

__This file demonstrates many of the basic concepts in React.__

- The Js/React code is in /src
- This app runs from a local brower that can be found at ... 
  - App.js
  - once the files are compiled, it can be run the the terminal command 'npm run start'
  - the React concepts I wrote can be found in the other folders inside /src
    - these concepts include ...
      - React Components
        - Functional 
        - Class
      - Props in React
        - (How to pass data between Components, paramaters)
        - accepting props as arguments
        - sending props as arguments 
      - React States 
        - explicitly defining states
          - state destructuring
          - modifying states in helper functions
        - setState
          - this.
          - modifying states with prevState 
        - lifecycle methods 
          - catch
          - mount
          - update
          - unmount
        - rendering API
          - async and await
      - React Hooks
        - useState
        - useEffect
        - useReducer
        - useContext
        - useRef-Dom
  - Many of these files and concepts use very basic aspects of html that do provide a UI.
  - This includes primarily ... 
    - onClick and onChange methods
      - handler functions to create functionality with this data that interact with states and hooks 
  - many of these files render all of the data in the brower, others are printed in the console.
  - The console can be found with a left click -> inspect -> (>>) -> console
  - these files can be ran by running App.js (explained above), then command forward slash while selecting the file you want ran in App.js

  - Hope you like my work!
